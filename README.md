# Mohammed Al-Hindi — Portfolio

Welcome to the repository that powers my personal portfolio. It shares my story as a Biomedical and Electrical Engineering
student, highlights signature projects, and presents leadership experiences that shape how I design with empathy.

## ✨ Highlights

- Story-first hero with quick facts and CTAs to explore projects or grab my email.
- Human-centered sections for About, Experience, Projects, Leadership, and Contact.
- Responsive layout with glassmorphism accents, subtle gradients, and accessible typography.
- Feather Icons and motion details that make interactions feel polished without heavy scripts.

## 🧰 Tech stack

- Semantic HTML5
- Modern CSS (custom properties, fluid spacing, CSS grid, flexbox)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for lightweight SVG icons

## 🚀 Getting started

Open the site locally by launching `index.html` in your browser of choice:

```bash
# from the project root
open index.html
```

> On Windows, double-click `index.html` or run `start index.html` from PowerShell.

## 📦 Deploying updates

All the refreshed layout and styling is committed. To publish the latest version to GitHub Pages:

```bash
git pull
git push origin main
```

Prefer the GitHub web interface? Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, and updated assets directly from the browser and publish.

### 🔄 Pushing from this Codespace/session

If you're working inside this environment and want the changes to appear on your GitHub repository:

1. Add your GitHub remote if it isn't configured yet:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
2. Verify the remote:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
3. Push the current branch (replace `main` if you're on another branch):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. Future pushes only need:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

This publishes the already-committed updates from the environment directly to your GitHub repository.

## 🛠️ Customize your story

- Adjust hero text, experience bullets, and project descriptions in `index.html` to reflect new wins.
- Swap out imagery (`headerpic.png`, `design.png`, `brainstorming.png`, `applying.png`) with your own visuals.
- Tweak theming in `style.css` by editing the custom properties at the top for colors, radii, and spacing.
